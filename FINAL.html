  <h2> The Current State of the NBA </h2>
</div>

<p> In 2023, NBA players are more talented than ever before. Today's players have had access to youth basketball leagues and more trainers than in previous generations, and have been training since elementary school. In addition, the game has also gone global. Not only are professional players making their way into the NBA from other countries, but are dominating in the league as well. Because of this, the NBA as a whole is more competitive than ever before. Franchises that have never won an NBA title before have become champions, most recently with the Toronto Raptors and Denver Nuggets, and the talent level across the NBA is spread pretty well across most teams. </p>

<p> Due to the NBA competition at an all-time high, teams are scrambling to find any competitive advantage they can get their hands on to push themselves ahead of other teams. One of these potential advantages: spending more money than ever before on their roster. Teams have given players "super-max" contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a last ditch effort to contend for an NBA title. Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown recently signed the biggest contract in NBA history, making over $300 milllion in five years. That number only gets bigger with every season, as more players are signing record setting contracts and making more and more money. But does all this spending actually contribute to team success?

  <h2> 2023 NBA Team Roster Spending </h2>
</div>

<p> To answer that question, we need to first take a look at how much money each NBA team spent last season, and compare that to the regular season standings and ultimately which team won the championship. The graph below depicts the total amount of money each team spent on its players last season. Atop the list are the Golden State Warriors who spent a total of $191 million on their roster last year.  Just below Golden State are the Los Angeles Clippers who spent $185 million. The 2023 NBA champion Denver Nuggets were 13th in team spending, with $159 million taken up by their players. At the bottom of the list are the Houston Rockets who only spent $56 million. Looking at the graph, most franchises fall between the $140-$160 million range. The Golden State Warriors who spent the most money, poured in approximately $135 million more dollars than the team who spent the least amount of money, the Houston Rockets.

  <h2> 2023 NBA Team Regular Season Standings</h2>
</div>

<p> Now that we have the player spending amounts in the 2022-2023 season for every NBA team, we must take a look at how each team performed that season. To do this, we'll look at the 2022-2023 regular season standings, while keeping in mind the teams that made the NBA Finals, and the NBA champion for that season. The graph below lists the NBA teams in order by regular season wins. The number of wins is organized as a percentage out of the total amount of regular season games played, 82. Right away, we can see that the Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics were the teams with the highest regular season win percentage at 71% and 70% respectively. The 2023 NBA Champion Denver Nuggets have the fourth highest regular season winning percentage at 65%. The Miami Heat, the other team to make the NBA finals, were near the middle of the pack winning 54% of their regular season games. The three worst teams were the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, and Houston Rockets, who won less than 30% of their games. </p>

  <h2> Spending Versus Team Success </h2>
</div>

<p> Now that we know the roster spending and standings for every NBA team in 2022-2023, we can see if the roster spending actually leads to more wins. Below is a scatterplot that graphs regular season wins due to roster spending. Each dot on the graph represents an NBA team.  </p>


<div class="viz">
  <iframe title="2023 NBA Team Spending vs Win Percentage" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-hYG1t" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hYG1t/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

<p> From this scatterplot, we see that generally, more NBA roster spending leads to more regular season wins. The two teams won the most regular season games, the Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics, spent over $170 million. The Golden State Warriors, who spent the most money in the NBA, won over half of their games. On the other side of the spectrum, the San Antonio Spurs and Houston Rockets spent less than $80 million and won the second and third least amount of regular season games. The Detroit Pistons had the lowest winning percentage and spent well below the average amount of money on their roster. There are a couple of exceptions to this trend however with the Portland Trail Blazers and Memphis Grizzlies. Portland spent over $160 million, but managed to win just 40% of regular season games. Memphis on the other hand, poured just $120 millon into their roster and had a winning percentage of over 60% The Denver Nuggets who won the championship, spent just under $160 million. Regardless, it appears that more roster spending usually leads to more team wins.  <p/>

  <h2> Why Does Spending More Money Lead To Wins? </h2>
</div>

<p> We now know that more roster spending usually equates to more wins, but it isn't exactly clear how or why just yet. To find an explanation for this, I showed my findings to Shane Sanders, a Sports Analytics professor at Syracuse University. Upon seeing the scatterplot he said that "it makes sense that the teams who spent the most saw the most success because they were able to go out and get the best players." The most talented NBA players demand very expensive contracts, so the teams who are able to sign these players instantly become contenders. He also pointed out that the NBA teams that are in big cities or markets, such as New York or Los Angeles, generate more revenue and have an easier time attracting better NBA players. Not only can they afford to spend more than small markets, but players want to play for a big market. Lastly, professsor Sanders noted that any injuries that happen during the season can drastically impact a team's chance to win the championship, even if they spent large amounts of money on a star in free agency. All of these factors determine team spending and whether it will provide success. </p>


<div class="headers">
  <h2> Should NBA Teams Spend More on Their Roster? </h2>
</div>

<p> NBA teams should spend more money on players to ensure the best chance of winning the NBA title. The Devner Nuggets won the 2023 NBA championship and had one of the most expensive rosters in the entire league. If NBA teams want to compete, they need to go the extra mile and acquire the best talent. However, getting the best talent doesnt guarantee wins. Injuries are a big part of the game, and adding too many players at once can severely damage team chemistry. In a league more talented than ever before, spending more money to acquire that talent can push teams over the edge. </p>
